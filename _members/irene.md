Irene Ramos-Vielba is currently an advisor to ANECA and scientists at the [Institute for Advanced Social Studies CSIC](https://www.iesa.csic.es/). She is also a member of the CoARA Steering Board.

Irene is a political scientist specializing in research and innovation policy, the societal value of research, and open science. As someone involved in research evaluation processes both from a research perspective and in practice, her knowledge is key to understand and explain the social mechanisms we will observe during the completion of the project, as well as in the design of mitigation strategies and the development of policy recommendations. She has previously worked on issues that overlap with team sciences such as research funding allocation, university-industry collaboration, and science-society multidirectional interactions.
