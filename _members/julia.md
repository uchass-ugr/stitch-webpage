Julia is a full professor at the Arizona State University and Director of the [Centre for Organization Research and Design](https://cord.asu.edu/) (CORD). She has extensively worked on research careers using network analysis based on survey data. She has specifically addressed the issue of gender inequalities in academia. In relation to her collaboration with the PI, she was the co-PI of the NSF-funded project [“Connecting nuances of foreign status, professional networks and higher education”](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1661206&HistoricalAwards=false) where I worked as a postdoctoral researcher. Since then, we have collaborated on various projects funded by the NSF and the Spanish Ministry of Science (e.g., [COMPARE](https://compare-project.eu/)).
